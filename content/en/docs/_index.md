## Overview

Amplify Gateway is a lightweight, cloud native API Gateway which enables API Providers to quickly secure their backend APIs using a range of authentication mechanisms, including OAuth, JWT Bearer Tokens and API Keys. Securing backend APIs via Amplify Gateway allows both data and business processes to be exposed securely for many use cases including point to point integrations as well as data exposed via the public web. In order to use a backend API proxied through and mediated by Amplify Gateway, consumers must first be granted access to the API and then have a credential  provisioned to enable them to securely call the API at runtime.
